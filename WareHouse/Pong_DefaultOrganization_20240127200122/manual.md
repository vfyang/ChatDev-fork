# Python Pong Game

This is a simple pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game includes two paddles and a ball. Each paddle can move up and down, and the ball moves in a random direction. If the ball hits a paddle, it bounces back. If the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen, the player on the opposite side scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center.

## Quick Install

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

Run `python main.py` in your terminal to start the game.

Player 1 uses the W and S keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.
Player 2 uses the Up and Down arrow keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.

The goal of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle and prevent it from reaching your side of the screen. If the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen, the player on the opposite side scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center.
