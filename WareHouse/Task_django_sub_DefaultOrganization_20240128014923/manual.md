Sure, here is the detailed user manual for our Django-based checklist management system:

# Checklist Management System

Our Checklist Management System is a Django-based web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The system integrates user and task management, allowing tasks to be assigned to different users. Each task includes a title, description, priority level, assignment, and ending date. The application uses Bootstrap and Vue.js for a responsive and interactive user interface, with a blue color theme.

## Main Features

- User Management: Register, login, and manage user profiles.
- Task Management: Create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- Task Assignment: Assign tasks to different users.
- Priority Level: Set and update the priority level of tasks.
- Ending Date: Set a deadline for each task.

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_link>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd checklist_management_system`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the database: `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`.
2. Register a new user or login if you already have an account.
3. Once logged in, you will see a list of tasks. You can create a new task by clicking on the 'New Task' button.
4. Fill in the task details: title, description, priority level, assignment, and ending date.
5. Click 'Save' to save the task. It will now appear in the task list.

## Folder Structure

The Django project follows the standard Django project structure:

```
manage.py
checklist_project/
    __init__.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
    asgi.py
    wsgi.py
app/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
    templates/
        app/
            task_list.html
```

The `manage.py` file is the main entrance python file for managing the Django project. The `models.py` file defines the Task model, and the `views.py` file defines the views for the Task model. The `urls.py` file defines the URLs for the Task views. The `task_list.html` file defines the HTML structure for the Task list view.
