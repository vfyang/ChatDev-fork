# Flappy Bird Dash Plotly

A Python-based application that recreates the popular Flappy Bird game using Dash Plotly.

## Quick Install

Before you can run the game, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install dash plotly
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Dash Plotly in Python. The game has been simplified for the sake of this demonstration. The bird moves up when you click the 'Jump' button and moves down otherwise. The bird needs to avoid the obstacles to score points.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

To start the game, run the `main.py` file in your Python environment. This will start a local server and the game will be accessible in your web browser.

```python
python main.py
```

Once the game is running, you will see a graph with two markers - one representing the bird and the other representing the obstacle. The bird moves up every time you click the 'Jump' button and moves down otherwise. The obstacle moves from right to left. 

Your score increases every time the bird successfully avoids the obstacle and decreases if the bird hits the obstacle. The score is displayed at the top of the graph.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

The game is implemented in two Python files - `main.py` and `game.py`.

`main.py` is the main file that runs the game. It creates a Dash app with a graph and a button. The graph is updated every second using a callback function that calls the `update` and `draw` methods of the `Game` class.

`game.py` contains the `Game` class that handles the game logic. The `Game` class has methods to update the game state and draw the current game state.

Please see the comments in the code for more detailed explanations of how the game works.
