# Pong Game Web Version

This is a simple yet fun web version of the classic Pong game. It's built with JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. The game includes a player-controlled paddle and an AI-controlled paddle. The player scores a point when the ball hits the opponent's side, and the AI scores a point when the ball hits the player's side.

## Quick Install

No installation is required as this is a web-based game. All you need is a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is a web version of the classic Pong game. The player controls a paddle on the left side of the screen and plays against an AI-controlled paddle on the right side. The goal of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it reach the opponent's side.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard to move your paddle.
3. The game starts immediately when the page loads. The ball moves automatically and bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the screen.
4. Each time the ball hits the opponent's side, you score a point. Each time the ball hits your side, the AI scores a point. The scores are displayed at the top of the screen.
5. The game continues indefinitely until you close the browser tab or window.
