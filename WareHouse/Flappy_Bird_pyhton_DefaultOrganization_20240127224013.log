Considering the customer's request, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. This is because the customer wants us to design a game, specifically a website version of the flappy bird game using Python. An application would allow us to implement the game and provide the user with an interactive experience. We can design the game to be played on a web browser, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including game development. However, for a web-based game like Flappy Bird, Python alone might not be the best choice. We would need to use a framework like Django or Flask to create the web application, and then use a library like Pygame for the game logic. 

However, a more common approach for web-based games is to use JavaScript along with HTML5 and CSS3. JavaScript is a language designed for the web, and it has powerful libraries like Phaser.js specifically for game development. 

Therefore, while Python could be used, JavaScript might be a better choice for this specific task.

Task: "design a website version flappy bird game, using python".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: design a website version flappy bird game, using python.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

I understand the task and the requirements. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Python is not typically used for creating web-based games. Instead, languages like JavaScript along with HTML and CSS are used. 

Python can be used to create desktop games using libraries like Pygame, but it's not suitable for web-based games. 

If the customer is open to it, we can create a desktop version of the Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame. Alternatively, we can create a web-based version using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

Please clarify which approach the customer would prefer.
