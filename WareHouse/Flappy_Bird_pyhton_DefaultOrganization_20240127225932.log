Given the customer's request, it seems clear that we should be focusing on creating an Application. The task involves designing a game, which fits perfectly into the application modality. Python is a versatile language that can be used to create a variety of applications, including games like Flappy Bird. We can leverage libraries like Pygame to make the development process smoother. 

However, we should also consider the Website modality. Since the customer specifically requested a website version of the game, we could develop a web-based application using a Python web framework like Django or Flask. This would allow the game to be played directly in the browser, increasing accessibility for users.

In conclusion, we should consider both Application and Website modalities for this project. We need to clarify with the customer whether they prefer a standalone application or a web-based game. Based on their preference, we can then decide on the final product modality.

Python is a powerful language that can be used to create a variety of applications, including games. However, for a web-based game like Flappy Bird, Python alone may not be sufficient. We would need to use additional frameworks and libraries such as Pygame for game development and Flask or Django for web development.

But, considering the performance and compatibility across different browsers and devices, JavaScript along with HTML5 and CSS3 might be a more suitable choice. JavaScript is the standard language for web development and it has many powerful libraries like Phaser.js specifically for game development.

Therefore, while Python is a great language, for this specific task, JavaScript might be a better choice.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "design a website version flappy bird game, using python".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application and website".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: design a website version flappy bird game, using python.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

I understand the task and the requirements. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Python is not typically used for creating website-based games. Instead, languages like JavaScript along with HTML and CSS are used for this purpose. 

Python can be used to create a desktop version of the Flappy Bird game, using libraries like Pygame. If the customer is okay with a desktop version, I can provide the Python code for that. 

If the customer specifically wants a website version, then we should use JavaScript along with HTML and CSS. 

Could you please confirm which version the customer wants?
